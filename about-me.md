title: About Me

Hi there! I'm Gioia Ballin and I'm a software developer, a blogger and a tech enthusiast. I love learning and experimenting new technologies as much as I love traveling and dancing.

*Here I was in LA, enjoying the sun and California's lifestyle.*


I come from Venice, Italy. Yes, exactly, the <strong>real</strong> Venice, one of the most wonderful cities in the world in which you can drink and shop in amazing places.

I studied "somewhere not so near to Venice", in [Padua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padua){:target="_blank"}. During the spring 2012, I graduated from the University of Padua with a Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering and, just after the graduation, I was involved in the [Google Summer of Code Program 2012](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012){:target="_blank"}. Both the master thesis project and the GSoC ’12 experience gave me the chance to work on complex computer vision problems, for which I coded solutions in C++ using [ROS](http://www.ros.org/){:target="_blank"} and [PCL](http://pointclouds.org/).

I began my pythonic experience in the mid-October 2012, when I got a backend software developer position at a tech company in the travel market. At that time, I didn’t know anything about [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"}. Soon, I learnt how to code with it and I began being more and more interested during the time. Since I was eager to increase my knowledge, I gradually switched from basic tutorials to more advanced topics. I ended up working on the server-side maintenance and development of the company's leading software service: a booking engine. I also became familiar with Python and with relational databases ([PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/){:target="_blank"} and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.it/){:target="_blank"}).

After almost three years spent as a Python developer, I felt I needed a change. First of all, I wanted to move from Venice. *Why?* Despite being a wonderful city, there's a sort of detachment from the technology trends. I was looking for an innovative, tech-friendly and plenty-of-opportunities city. Second, I wanted to work with a different technology. *Why? Python is so exciting!* I would say... for personal improvement. I wanted to increase my skill set and one way to do so was working with different tools. Long story short, I needed to live a disrupting experience so, I decided to move to Milan and I began working as a (almost) full-stack software developer at one of the most promising startups in the fintech field. *Did I have fun?* Yes, definitely.

During this first experience in Milan, I mainly worked on a web application built using [Spring](https://spring.io/){:target="_blank"} (server-side) with [Thymeleaf](http://www.thymeleaf.org/){:target="_blank"}, HTML5 and Javascript (client-side). The application was compiled and packaged using [Gradle](http://gradle.org/){:target="_blank"}. You can see clearly that all these technologies were outside the comfort zone of my knowledge. So, I started learning from scratch (yes, again) how to use these technologies and I ended up learning an unexpected amount of information even faster than before.

After six months in the fintech marketplace, I decided to start a new working experience in the Big Data/Analytics field. Right now, I'm a backend software developer mainly working with Python and [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/){:target="_blank"}, but sometimes I also deal with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:target="_blank"}. Starting from the algorithms unveiled by researchers during scientific conferences, my job is about inventing, implementing and testing new algorithms suitable for the use in real-world applications. Literally, **I bring the research into the real world**.

The world is moving faster and I'm trying to move as faster as the world itself. It's tough, but it's worth trying.
